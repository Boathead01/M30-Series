.elf file for understanding how debugging and compilation process works, in our ARM, we have .axf
download the GNU tools for separate debugging tools which aren't available in keil
go to cmd in administration mode

don't do setx like this, it truncates:
setx /M PATH "%PATH%;C:\Users\Yasmin\Downloads\arm-gnu-toolchain-14.2.rel1-mingw-w64-x86_64-arm-none-eabi\bin"

do this:
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Users\Yasmin\Downloads\arm-gnu-toolchain-14.2.rel1-mingw-w64-x86_64-arm-none-eabi\bin

check version:
arm-none-eabi-objdump --version

to disassemble:
locate to the code file path, in this case Level1_GPIO_Ctrl
arm-none-eabi-objdump.exe -d Level1_GPIO_Ctrl.axf

-d is taken from the objdump library, which can be viewed by:
arm-none-eabi-objdump.exe
-s is to look at the whole memory allocation for both code and data, memory represented in hex value
